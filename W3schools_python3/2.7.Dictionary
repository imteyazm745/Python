Dictionary
Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.

Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:

Example : Create and print a dictionary:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)

Dictionary Items
Dictionary items are ordered, changeable, and does not allow duplicates.
Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.

Example : Print the "brand" value of the dictionary:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict["brand"])

Ordered or Unordered?
When we say that dictionaries are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.

Unordered means that the items does not have a defined order, you cannot refer to an item by using an index.

Changeable
Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.

Duplicates Not Allowed
Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key:

Example : Duplicate values will overwrite existing values:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964,
  "year": 2020
}
print(thisdict) #{'brand': 'Ford', 'model': 'Mustang', 'year': 2020}

Dictionary Length
To determine how many items a dictionary has, use the len() function:

Example : Print the number of items in the dictionary:
print(len(thisdict)) #3

Dictionary Items - Data Types
The values in dictionary items can be of any data type:

Example
String, int, boolean, and list data types:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "electric": False,
  "year": 1964,
  "colors": ["red", "white", "blue"]
}
# {'brand': 'Ford', 'electric': False, 'year': 1964, 'colors': ['red', 'white', 'blue']}

type()
From Python's perspective, dictionaries are defined as objects with the data type 'dict':
<class 'dict'>

Example
Print the data type of a dictionary:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(type(thisdict)) #<class 'dict'>

The dict() Constructor
It is also possible to use the dict() constructor to make a dictionary.

ExampleGet your own Python Server
Using the dict() method to make a dictionary:

thisdict = dict(name = "John", age = 36, country = "Norway")
print(thisdict) # {'name': 'John', 'age': 36, 'country': 'Norway'}

Python Collections (Arrays)
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

Python - Access Dictionary Items
Accessing Items : You can access the items of a dictionary by referring to its key name, inside square brackets:
Example : Get the value of the "model" key:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
x = thisdict["model"] #Mustang

There is also a method called get() that will give you the same result:

Example : Get the value of the "model" key:
x = thisdict.get("model") #Mustang

Get Keys : The keys() method will return a list of all the keys in the dictionary.
Example : Get a list of the keys:
x = thisdict.keys() #dict_keys(['brand', 'model', 'year'])

The list of the keys is a view of the dictionary, meaning that any changes done to the dictionary will be reflected in the keys list.
Example : Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the keys list gets updated as well:
car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
x = car.keys()
print(x) #before the change
car["color"] = "white"
print(x) #after the change

#dict_keys(['brand', 'model', 'year'])
#dict_keys(['brand', 'model', 'year', 'color'])

Get Values
The values() method will return a list of all the values in the dictionary.

ExampleGet your own Python Server
Get a list of the values:

x = thisdict.values()
The list of the values is a view of the dictionary, meaning that any changes done to the dictionary will be reflected in the values list.

ExampleGet your own Python Server
Make a change in the original dictionary, and see that the values list gets updated as well:

car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}

x = car.values()

print(x) #before the change

car["year"] = 2020

print(x) #after the change

ExampleGet your own Python Server
Add a new item to the original dictionary, and see that the values list gets updated as well:

car = {
"brand": "Ford",
"model": "Mustang",
"year": 1964
}
x = car.values()
print(x) #before the change
car["color"] = "red"
print(x) #after the change

#dict_values(['Ford', 'Mustang', 1964])
#dict_values(['Ford', 'Mustang', 1964, 'red'])
