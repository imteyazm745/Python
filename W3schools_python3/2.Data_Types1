Python Numbers
There are three numeric types in Python:

int
float
complex
Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:

Example
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j   # complex
To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function:

Example
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
