Sets
A set is an unordered collection of distinct hashable elements.
Sets are often used for:
    Efficiently checking if an element is contained in a collection.
    Eliminating duplicate entries from a collection.
    Representing abstract sets, with access to mathematical operators such as intersection and union.

A set looks like this:
s = {1, 3, 4}

A set is delimited by curly braces, and its elements are separated by commas.
Creating a Set
A set can be built either as an empty collection, or from an iterable of elements:
empty_set = set()
set_from_list = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1, 2]) # => {1, 2, 3, 4}

In the above snippet, why do I create an empty set using set() and not {}?
Common Set Operations
As an iterable type, a set supports the usual operations that work with iterables, such as checking the size of the set, checking for element containment, and looping over it:
# A basket of fruit names.
basket = {"apple", "orange", "apple", "pear", "banana"}

# How many unique fruit names are there?
len(basket)            # => 4

# Does the basket contain these elements?
"orange" in basket     # => True
"crabgrass" in basket  # => False

# Loop over the elements of the basket.
for fruit in basket:
    print(fruit)  # prints 'apple', 'banana', 'orange', and 'pear'.

Due to how set is implemented in Python, it's relatively efficient to evaluate the expression elem in basket.
Set Operations
Sets in Python can be modified by adding, removing, or discarding elements, among other operations:
a = set("mississippi")  # {'i', 'm', 'p', 's'}

a.add('r')
a.remove('m')  # Raises a KeyError if 'm' is not present.
a.discard('x')  # Same as `remove`, except will not raise an error.

a.pop()  # => 's' (or 'i' or 'p')
a.clear()
len(a)  # => 0
