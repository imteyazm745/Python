Mappings
A mapping is a mutable map from hashable values to arbitrary objects. There is just one standard mapping type – dict – although a few more live in the collections module.
Mappings are often used for:
Encoding associative information
Capturing plain data with named fields.
Building more complicated data structures.
Dictionary : It’s this mutable association between keys and value.
Creating a dict
There are many ways to create a dictionary:
# Create an empty dictionary.
empty = {}
type(empty)      # => dict
empty == dict()  # => True
