Additional Collections
So far, we looked at a few of the built-in types in Python's language. However, Python's standard library includes the collections module, which provides a few more useful, specialized container types.
collections.namedtuple – factory function for creating tuple subclasses with named fields
collections.defaultdict – dict subclass that calls a factory function to supply missing values
collections.Counter – dict subclass for counting hashable objects
These objects are particularly useful for making your code simpler or more readable, and tend to crush interview problems.

Non-Topics

frozenset: A concrete type representing an immutable Set, whose hashable instances can be used as elements in sets or as keys in dictionaries.
Using the nonlocal and global statements – instruct the parser to change the behavior of binding new variable assignments to the local namespace.
