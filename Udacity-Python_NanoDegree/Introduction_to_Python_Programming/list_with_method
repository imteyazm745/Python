# Data structures are containers that organize and group data types togetherin different ways. A list is one of the most common and basic data structures in python.
# List = A List is data structure in Python that is a mutable, ordered, sequence of elements,
#Example => list_of_random_things = [1, 3.4, 'a string', True]
#Example 2
months = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July', 'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']
print(months[0]) # January
print(months[1]) # February
print(months[7]) # August
print(months[-1]) # December
print(months[25]) # IndexError: list index out of range

list Method

Useful Functions for Lists I
len() : returns how many elements are in a list.
max() : returns the greatest element of the list. How the greatest element is determined depends on what type objects are in the list. The maximum element in a list of numbers is the largest number. The maximum elements in a list of strings is element that would occur last if the list were sorted alphabetically. This works because the the max function is defined in terms of the greater than comparison operator. The max function is undefined for lists that contain elements from different, incomparable types.
min() : returns the smallest element in a list. min is the opposite of max, which returns the largest element in a list.
sorted() : returns a copy of a list in order from smallest to largest, leaving the list unchanged.

name = 'Jim'
student = name
name = 'Tim'
print(name) #Tim
print(student) #Jim

ascending & descending order: 

sizes = [15, 6, 89, 34, 65, 35]
print(sorted(sizes)) #[6, 15, 34, 35, 89]
print(sorted(sizes, reverse=True)) #[89, 35, 34, 15, 6]

max & min

batch_sizes = [15, 6, 89, 34, 65, 35]
print(max(batch_sizes)) # 89

a = ['bravo', 'Aamir', 'Baltzman', 'Rajesh', Anoop]
print(max(a)) # Rajesh => according to alphabet

Useful Function Lists II
Join method : Join is a string method that takes a list of strings as an argument, and returns a string consisting of the list elements joined by a separator string.

new_str = "\n".join(["fore", "aft", "starboard", "port"])
print(new_str)

Output:

fore
aft
starboard
port
