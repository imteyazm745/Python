Converting Values
As with the fundamental building blocks, these types can be constructed from one another.
The str constructor accepts any object and returns a string representation of that object:
str([3, 4, 5])  # => '[3, 4, 5]'
str((1, 4, 9))  # => '(1, 4, 9)'
The universality of string representations will reappear when we discuss custom classes.
The list and tuple constructors can be constructed as empty, or constructed with the elements of another iterable:
list()  # An empty list.
tuple()  # An empty tuple.

list(range(5))  # => [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
tuple(range(5))  # => (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
 
Recall that, when interpreted as an iterable, a string produces a stream of its characters. That is:
list("ABC")  # => ["A", "B", "C"]
tuple("XYZ")  # => ("X", "Y", "Z")

Special Case: .split and .join â€“ Converting from str to list or from an Iterable to str.
It's common to need to convert between strings and lists. Python provides two great tools here:
# `split` partitions a string by a delimiter into a list
'ham cheese bacon'.split()
# => ['ham', 'cheese', 'bacon']
'03-30-2016'.split(sep='-')
# => ['03', '30', '2016']

# `join` creates a string from an iterable (of strings)
', '.join(['Eric', 'John', 'Michael'])
# => "Eric, John, Michael"
Sized
Any object that is Sized can be used with the len function, which returns the number of items in a container. For example:
len("ABC")  # => 3
len((1, 2, 4, 8))  # => 4
len(["do", "re", "mi", "fa", "so"])  # => 5
 
Container
Any object that is a Container can be used in the expression element in container. For example:
'd' in 'Udacity'  # => True
12 in [5, 12, 13]  # => True
(3, 4, 5) in ((3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), (6, 8, 10), (7, 24, 25))  # => True

Iterable
Any object that is an Iterable knows how to produce its elements one at a time in a stream. An extraordinary number of built-in functions consume or produce iterables. For example, if we had an iterable named iterable or an iterable of iterables named iterables, we could run:
max(iterable)
min(iterable)
 
val in iterable
val not in iterable
 
all(iterable)
any(iterable)
 
# Produce iterables.
zip(*iterables)
enumerate(iterable)
 
filter(pred, iterable)
map(fn, iterable)
Slicing Strings
hello = 'Hello, world!'
a = hello[0]
b = hello[-2]
c = hello[1:5]
d = hello[-6:]
e = hello[::2]
f = hello[::-1]
Palindrome
def make_palindrome(s):
    return s + s[::-1]   
Pascal's Triangle
def add_layer(triangle):
    last = triangle[-1]  # The most recent row of Pascal's triangle.
    row = []  # Build up the next row.
    for left, right in zip(last + (0,), (0,) + last):
        row.append(left + right)
    triangle.append(tuple(row))
The next row could have also been computed using a comprehension:
def add_layer(triangle):
    last = triangle[-1]
    triangle.append(tuple(left + right for left, right in zip(last + (0,), (0,)
