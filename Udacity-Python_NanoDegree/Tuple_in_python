A tuple is a fixed-size immutable[can’t change its values] sequence of arbitrary data.
pet = (1, ‘dog’)
pet[0]  # => 1
pet[1]  # => ‘dog
The pet value is a 2-tuple whose value at position 0 is the integer 1 
and whose value at position 1 is the string 'dog'

Tuples support all of the methods of a Sequence, which practically means that they behave almost exactly like a list, except that the collection is immutable.
