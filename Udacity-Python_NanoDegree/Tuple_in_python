A tuple is a fixed-size immutable[can’t change its values] sequence of arbitrary data.
pet = (1, ‘dog’)
pet[0]  # => 1
pet[1]  # => ‘dog
The pet value is a 2-tuple whose value at position 0 is the integer 1 
and whose value at position 1 is the string 'dog'

Tuples support all of the methods of a Sequence, which practically means that 
they behave almost exactly like a list, except that the collection is immutable.

fish = (1, 2, "red", "blue")  # Create a tuple.

fish[0]  # => 1
fish[0] = 7  # Raises a TypeError. Tuples are immutable!

# Usual sequence methods work.
len(fish)  # => 4
fish[:2]  # => (1, 2)
"red" in fish  # => True
