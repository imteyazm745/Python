Iterators
An iterator represents a (finite or infinite) stream of data.

The next(iter) call asks an iterator to yield a successive value. 
If there are no more values, it raises StopIteration. 
The iter(data) function produces an iterator from an iterable data source.

Using Iterators
You can build an iterator from data:

# Build an iterator over [1,2,3]
it = iter([1,2,3])
next(it)  # => 1
next(it)  # => 2
next(it)  # => 3
next(it)  # raises StopIteration error

Iterators are fundamental to the language. The humble for loop is really using an iterator!

for element in data:
    process(element)

# actually behaves like

for element in iter(data):
    process(element)
