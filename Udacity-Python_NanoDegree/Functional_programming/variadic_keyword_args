Variadic Keyword Parameters
A parameter of the form **name (such as**kwargs) in a function signature introduces a variadic keyword parameter.
This parameter will capture excess keyword-supplied arguments into a dictionary named the same thing, such as kwargs.

Why would you ever do something like this? Usually, variadic keyword parameters are useful when you're either:
    1.Allowing arbitrary named parameters for special configuration
    2. As with variadic positional parameters, capturing an unknown collection of arguments, 
          in order to forward them to another handler, like a superclass, a decorator, or other fancy objects.
