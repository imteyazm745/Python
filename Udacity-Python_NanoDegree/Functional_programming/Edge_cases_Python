The operator module
Python has an operator module built-in to the standard library. 
It provides standard operators as functions, so you can use them in functional contexts.
For example, operator.add(a, b) performs the same operation as a + b, and operator.lt(a, b) performs
the same operation as a < b. The module even has some high-level advanced tools â€“ the expression a[1] can also be operator.itemgetter(1)(a), 
which means that you could use the function operator.itemgetter(1) in a map expression or as a key to the sort function.
