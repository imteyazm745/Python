Sequence :	An ordered collection of data.
Slicing :	Special syntax for accessing or updating elements or subsequences of data from a sequence type.
str :	An immutable sequence of characters.

Three Sequence types are 
list : a mutable collection of heterogenous data
Tuple : an immutable collection of heterogenous data
Str : an immutable sequence of characters.

Python provides a tool to access individual characters or subsequences of characters from a string:

s = 'Udacity'

# Access an element by index, starting at position 0.
s[0] == 'U'
s[1] == 'd'
s[4] == 'i'
s[7] # Bad!

# Access an element by a negative index, starting at the end.
s[-1] == 'y'
s[-2] == 't'
s[-4] == 'c'
s[-7] == 'U'

Python also provides a way to extract a slice of characters from a string:

s[0:2] == 'Ud'
s[4:7] == 'ity'
s[1:5] == 'daci'
