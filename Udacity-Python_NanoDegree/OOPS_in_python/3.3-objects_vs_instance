Class : 
A class is a collection of objects. 
A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created. 
It is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods. 

Classes are created by keyword class.
Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.
Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. Eg.: Myclass.Myattribute

To create a class object in Python, use the following syntax:

class ClassName:
    <statement>
    <statement>
    ...
    <statement>

Let's try to make our first class object together:

class MyFirstClass:
    """A simple example class."""
    num = 12345
    def greet(self):
        return "Hello, world"

Now, we have a new class object accessible at the name MyFirstClass:

print(MyFirstClass)  # <class 'MyFirstClass'>
print(MyFirstClass.num)  # 12345
print(MyFirstClass.greet)  # <function MyFirstClass.greet(self)>

print(type(MyFirstClass.__dict__))  # something that acts a lot like a normal dictionary
print('num' in MyFirstClass.__dict__)  # True
print('greet' in MyFirstClass.__dict__)  # True
