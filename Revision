Python Syntax : 
print("Hello, World!")  # => Hello, World!

Python Indentation : Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Example
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")

Python Variables : Variables are containers for storing data values.
Variable Names
A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
Variable names are case-sensitive.
String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:

In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it:
Example ; Variables in Python:
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!"
print(x)
print(y)

Casting : If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.

Example
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

Get the Type
You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.

Example
x = 5
y = "John"
print(type(x))
print(type(y))

Comments : Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.

Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:

Example : Comments in Python:

#This is a comment.
print("Hello, World!")

Multi Line Comments
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
